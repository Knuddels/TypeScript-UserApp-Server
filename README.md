# TypeScript-UserApp-Server
In this project I will provide a npm-based setup to write the server part of a UserApp in TypeScript and compile it to JavaScript that runs on @Knuddels UserApp servers.

# Dependencies
Since we use NPM to manage the tools we need you have to install the newest stable version of Node.js first before you can start.

# How does it work?
Just clone this repository or copy everything to the desired place on your computer. Since there is already some code for a lovely TypeScript demonstration app already in this repository, you can instantly start compiling something!
- open a terminal/commandline in the directory where all the files are now
- run "npm install" and wait for everything to be installed
- run "npm run build-server" to actually compile the dummy app
- a "main.js" file will be created
- Tada!

# How to test it?
Now you just have to follow the usual deployment process (see here: https://bitbucket.org/knuddels/user-apps/wiki/DeineErsteApp).
